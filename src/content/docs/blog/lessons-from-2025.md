2025 was a year of transition for the MRS Software Team. We went from six members in the summer of 2024 to two members in the summer of 2025. We've got the support of several others at MRS who can write code, but it's been a big adjustment to learn how to optimize our workflows to continue to produce high quality software at a steady rate with fewer engineers.

## Establishing documentation habits is worth it

_but it doesn't mean you'll get automatic buy-in_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->
- Mention new site mrs-electronics.dev
- Mention the drawbacks of copy-and-paste as the go-to for setting up new projects

## Automated tooling is essential

_use it wherever you can_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->
- Just files
- Linters
- Formatters
- Go lang is great because it has great automated tooling built in

## LLM-based tooling can be a huge productivity boost

_but it should be embraced cautiously_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->
- Mention initial experiments with aider.chat
- Mention opencode.ai
- Mention ampcode.com
- Mention code review bot

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Write closing paragraph -->

Something to wrap it all up.
