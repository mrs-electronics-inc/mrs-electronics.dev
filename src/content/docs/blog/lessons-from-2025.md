2025 was a year of transition for the MRS Software Team. We went from six members in the summer of 2024 to two members in the summer of 2025. We've got the support of several others at MRS who can write code, but it's been a big adjustment to learn how to optimize our workflows to continue to produce high quality software at a steady rate with fewer engineers.

## Establishing documentation habits is worth it

_but it doesn't mean you'll get automatic buy-in_

- Mention new site mrs-electronics.dev
- Mention the drawbacks of copy-and-paste as the go-to for setting up new projects

## LLM-based tooling can be a huge productivity boost

_but it should be embraced cautiously_

- Mention initial experiments with aider.chat
- Mention opencode.ai
- Mention ampcode.com
- Mention code review bot

## Something about open source

_some tagline below it_

## Conclusion

Something to wrap it all up.
