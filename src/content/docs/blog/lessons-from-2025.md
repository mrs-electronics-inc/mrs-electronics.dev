2025 was a year of transition for the MRS Software Team. We went from six members in the summer of 2024 to two members in the summer of 2025. We've got the support of several others at MRS who can write code, but it's been a big adjustment to learn how to optimize our workflows to continue to produce high quality software at a steady rate with fewer engineers.

## Standardization

_a smooth path is easier to walk than a bumpy one_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->

### Project Management

- Mention the drawbacks of copy-and-paste as the go-to for setting up new projects
- Mention standard repo setup across GitLab/GitHub (we now have internal templates/checklists for each new repo)
  - Mention repo template - https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/basic-template

### Documentation

- Mention embracing Astro framework
- Mention new site mrs-electronics.dev
- Mention project doc site and docs template - https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/docs-template

## Automated Tooling

_shortens feedback loops so developers move faster with confidence_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->

### Integration

- CI/CD: building APKs for app releases
- CI/CD: running automated tests on merge/pull requests for active projects
- Code review bot: fast feedback on simple mistakes (e.g., misconfigured CI/CD yaml)

### Local Development

- Just files
- Linters
- Formatters
- Go lang is great because it has great automated tooling built in

### Implementation

- AI agents: faster way to type code - take ideas from brain to code FASTER
- Mention openrouter.ai - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention initial experiments with aider.chat - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention opencode.ai - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention ampcode.com - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention into new habit of adding AGENTS.md to most projects
  - useful place to store llm "memorires" after they make mistakes
- Mention specture system - https://github.com/specture-system/specture
  - new system for spec-drive software architecture

## Open Source

_a shared place for fixes and features_

<!-- TODO: Expand this section with narrative and examples like 2024 structure -->

### Customer SDKs

- Customer SDKs: shared code customers can pull from (and maybe contribute to)
- Customer SDKs: central place for bug fixes and new features

### Developer Tools

- Developer tools: creative outlet for helper apps (e.g., time-tracker - INCLUDE LINK)
- Developer tools: CI/CD tooling and bots that improve developer quality of life - INCLUDE LINK to bots repo

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Write closing paragraph -->

Something to wrap it all up.
