2025 was a year of transition for the MRS Software Team. We went from six members in the summer of 2024 to two members in the summer of 2025. We've got the support of several others at MRS who can write code, but it's been a big adjustment to learn how to optimize our workflows to continue to produce high quality software at a steady rate with fewer engineers.

## Standardization

_a smooth and consistent path is easier to walk than a rough and chaotic one_

Standardization was a big focus of 2025. The goal was to reduce the difference

<!-- TODO: flesh out introduction -->

### Project Management

In 2025, we made good progress on standardizing our project management practices. We have developed a set of best practices through trial and experience across different projects the past few years, and it was time to apply them consistently, so every project could benefit from a more efficient workflow. Of course, every project has its own unique constraints, requirements, and team. We don't have a NEED BETTER WORDING HERE system that we treat as law. Instead, we have developed a set of general project management best practices including things like: how to label issues, how to merge changes, how to handle branching, and how to handle deployments.

<!-- TODO -->

- Mention standard repo setup across GitLab/GitHub (we now have internal templates/checklists for each new repo)
  - Mention repo template - https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/basic-template
- Mention future of integrating GitLab custom fields and status - include link to docs
- Mention specture system - https://github.com/specture-system/specture
  - new system for spec-drive software architecture
  - focused on projects that have single/few devs and a lot of agent-based development

### Documentation

<!-- TODO -->

- Mention embracing Astro framework
- Mention new site mrs-electronics.dev
- Mention project doc site and docs template - https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/docs-template

## Automated Tooling

_shortens feedback loops, so developers move faster with confidence_

From the start, we saw the need to create some sort of force multiplier (TODO: USE BETTER WORDING) for our team. Automated tooling is a powerful tool for leverage.

<!-- TODO: flesh out introduction -->

### Integration

<!-- TODO -->

- CI/CD: team dove into Docker and containerization at the beginning of the year
- CI/CD: running automated tests on merge/pull requests for active projects
- CI/CD: building APKs for mobile app releases
- Code review bot: fast feedback on simple mistakes (e.g., misconfigured CI/CD yaml)

### Local Development

<!-- TODO -->

- Just files
- Linters
- Formatters
- Go lang is great because it has great automated tooling built in

### Implementation

<!-- TODO -->

- AI agents: faster way to type code - take ideas from brain to code FASTER
- Mention openrouter.ai - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention initial experiments with aider.chat - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention opencode.ai - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention ampcode.com - INCLUDE LINK
- Mention into new habit of adding AGENTS.md to most projects
  - useful place to store llm "memorires" after they make mistakes

## Open Source

_a shared place for fixes and features_

<!-- TODO: add introduction -->

### Customer SDKs

<!-- TODO -->

- Customer SDKs: shared code customers can pull from (and maybe contribute to)
- Customer SDKs: central place for bug fixes and new features

### Developer Tools

<!-- TODO -->

- Developer tools: creative outlet for helper apps (e.g., time-tracker - INCLUDE LINK)
- Developer tools: CI/CD tooling and bots that improve developer quality of life - INCLUDE LINK to bots repo

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Write closing paragraph -->

Something to wrap it all up.
